Module steps using the Magnetic Module (GEN1 or GEN2, only on the OT-2) appear as magnet steps in the "Add step" menu. When you add a magnet step, the form shows the deck slot the module is on and any labware currently in the module. 

Use the toggle switch to engage or disengage the module's magnets. The form also lets you specify the height in the module at
which the magnets will engage. Valid ranges are different for the
Magnetic Module GEN1 (0 to 45 mm) and GEN2 (-2.5 to 25 mm).

Before moving labware from a Magnetic Module, set the magnet
state to “Disengage” to avoid sample disruption. 

The Magnetic Block (GEN1, only on the Flex) is unpowered and
cannot be controlled by the robot. Load the Magnetic Block on the
protocol starting deck and use a move step to place labware in the
Magnetic Block.
