In Protocol Designer, you'll define the hardware, labware, and liquids the robot will use during a protocol. This manual details how to use Protocol Designer to build protocols for the Opentrons Flex or OT-2 in four steps: 

| Step | Description | 
| ---- | ----------- | 
| Create a protocol | Specify your robot, pipettes, modules, and other hardware (like the Flex Gripper). | 
| Protocol starting deck | Edit your robot's starting deck, including instruments, liquids, and labware. | 
| Protocol steps | Create and edit protocol steps. | 
| Export protocol | Save a protocol file to import into the Opentrons App and run on the robot. | 


All protocol design takes place in your web browser. After creating and editing your protocol, you can export it as a Python file and import it into the Opentrons App to run on the robot like any other protocol. 

## Protocol Designer Requirements

Protocol Designer requires an internet connection and is currently only supported in Google Chrome. For the best experience, use the latest version of Chrome, maximize your browser window size, and zoom out if needed. 

Newly designed or modified protocol files created in Protocol Designer require Opentrons App version 8.5.1 or higher to run on your robot. While you can use Protocol Designer to modify JSON files previously created in earlier versions, you'll only be create and export Python files from Protocol Designer 8.5.0 and newer. 

## Protocol Designer Settings

Click the settings icon in the upper right to access Protocol Designer settings. Here, you can view this software manual and release notes in the App Info links. 

Protocol Designer shows hints, tips, and timeline editing suggestions to help you fix protocol warnings and errors. You can restore all hints and tips shown during protocol editing and toggle timeline editing guidance on and off. 

You can choose to share analytics with Opentrons to improve Protocol Designer and other services. To report a Protocol Designer bug, contact [Opentrons Support]( mailto:support@opentrons.com).
