# **Protocol Designer Instruction Manual**

[Protocol Designer](https://designer.opentrons.com/) is a no-code, web-based tool for developing protocols that run on Opentrons robots, including the Flex and the OT-2. You can use Protocol Designer to create protocols that: 

* Mix and transfer liquids, including advanced pipetting techniques.
* Operate Opentrons modules.
* Move labware around the deck, including on and off of modules.
* Pause to verify progress or access your samples.
