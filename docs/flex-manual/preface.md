# Preface

Welcome to the instruction manual for the Opentrons Flex liquid handling robot. This manual guides you through just about everything you need to know to set up and use Flex, focusing on topics that are most relevant to everyday users of Flex in a lab environment.

## Structure of this manual

Opentrons Flex is a complex system, so there are many different paths to learning everything it can do. Feel free to jump straight to the chapter that addresses whatever topic you're curious about! For example, if you already have a Flex set up in your lab, you can skip past the Installation and Relocation chapter.

If you prefer a guided approach, this manual is structured so you can follow it from beginning to end.

- **Learn about Flex.** The distinguishing features of Flex are listed in [Chapter 1: Introduction](introduction.md). The introduction also includes important safety and regulatory information.

- **Get started with Flex.** If you need to set up your Flex, follow the detailed instructions in [Chapter 2: Installation and Relocation](installation-relocation.md). Then familiarize yourself with the components of Flex in [Chapter 3: System Description](system-description.md).

- **Set up your deck.** Configuring the deck enables different scientific applications on Flex.  [Chapter 4: Modules](modules.md) describes Opentrons peripherals that you can install into or on top of the deck to perform specific scientific tasks. [Chapter 5: Labware](labware.md) explains how to work with equipment for holding liquids.

- **Run a protocol.** The core use of Flex is running standardized scientific procedures, known as protocols. [Chapter 6: Protocol Development](protocol-development.md) offers several ways to get ready-made protocols or design them yourself. To run your protocol, follow the instructions in [Chapter 7: Software and Operation](software-operation.md), which also has instructions for performing other tasks and customizing your robot's settings.

- **Keep Flex running.** Follow the advice in [Chapter 8: Maintenance and Service](maintenance-service.md) to keep your Flex clean and running optimally. Or sign up for one of the Opentrons services listed there and let us take care of Flex for you.

- **Learn even more.** Still need something else? Consult the appendices.

    - [Appendix A: Glossary](glossary.md) defines Flex-related terms.

    - [Appendix B: Additional Documentation](additional-documentation.md) points you to even more resources for Opentrons products and writing code to control Flex.
    
    - [Appendix C: Open-Source Software](open-source-software.md) explains how Opentrons software is hosted on GitHub as a resource for both developers and non-developers.
    
    - [Appendix D: Support and Contact Information](support-contact-information.md) lists how to get in touch with Opentrons if you need assistance beyond what our documentation provides.

## Notes and warnings

Throughout this manual, you'll find specially formatted note and warning
blocks. Notes provide helpful information that may not be obvious in the
ordinary course of using Flex. Pay special attention to warnings---they
are only used in situations where you run the risk of personal injury,
damage to equipment, loss or spoilage of samples or reagents, data loss,
or other harm.

Notes and warnings look like this:

!!! note
    **Sample Note:** This is something you ought to know, but it doesn't pose any danger.

!!! warning
    **Sample Warning:** This is something you need to know because there is risk associated with it.
