# Pre-installation Information

Review this section for important information about Stacker placement, deck adapters, the power/data hub, and other components.

## Deck Locations

You attach a Stacker to the right side of the robot with its deck slot adapter. You can install the adapter in any available column 3 deck slot (A3 to D3). The adapter also provides labware storage in column 3, so you donâ€™t lose any deck space.

Once attached, the Stacker becomes part of column 4, like a [staging area slot](https://opentrons.com/products/opentrons-flex-deck-expansion-set-4-count). Refer to deck coordinates for column 4 (A4 to D4) when programming the robot to access the Stacker. See [Hardware Modules](https://docs.opentrons.com/v2/new_modules.html) in our API documentation for more information.

After your Stacker is attached to the deck and powered on, instructions and animated images on the touchscreen take you through a guided setup.

Because you can install a Stacker anywhere in column 4, and connect it to any port on the power/data hub, the touchscreen setup process gives you the opportunity to tell Flex where this module is on the deck. See [Post-Installation Procedures](postinstall.md).

## Deck Adapters

Each Stacker ships with its own deck plate adapter. The adapter secures the Stacker to the deck of your robot.

A separate Waste Chute Adapter (shown below) allows you to install the Stacker and the [Waste Chute](https://opentrons.com/products/opentrons-flex-waste-chute-gen1) in adjacent slots (D3 and D4).

## Power and Data Hub

This external component provides power to the Stacker and bidirectional data connectivity between each attached Stacker and your Flex.

![Stacker power and data hub](images/power-hub.png){: .img-medium }

All the module's power and data cables route through the hub, which can support up to four Stackers on the same robot. The on/off switch on the hub controls power to all connected Stackers. The four labeled ports (S-1 through S-4) help you identify each Stacker's deck location during setup.

### Physical Connections

The following illustration shows the physical cable connections on the hub. [Part 4 of the installation instructions](installation.md#part-4-connecting-the-hub-and-cables) will provide more information about how to connect these cables.

The following table lists and describes the function of each cable.

## Installing Multiple Stackers

The [installation instructions](installation.md) in this guide assume you're installing one Stacker only. If you're installing multiple Stackers on the same Flex:

* Attach only one Stacker at a time. Complete all of the installation and post-installation procedures before installing the next module.
* Attach Stackers from the rear (A4) to the front (D4). This prevents the need to work around previously installed modules.
