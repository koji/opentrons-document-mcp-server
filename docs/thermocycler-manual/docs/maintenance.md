Be sure to turn the Thermocycler's power off before cleaning it. You can clean the top surfaces of the module while it is installed in a deck slot. However, for better access, you may want to:

- Disconnect any USB or power cables before you begin.
- Remove the caddy (Flex only) and module from the deck slot.
- Remove the module from the caddy (Flex only).

Once youâ€™ve prepared the module for cleaning:

1. Dampen a soft, clean cloth or paper towel with a cleaning solution.
2. Gently wipe off the module's surfaces.
3. Rinse off any remaining residue using a cloth dampened with distilled water.
4. Let the module air dry.
