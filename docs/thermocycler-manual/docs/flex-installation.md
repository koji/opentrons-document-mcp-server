title: "Thermocycler Module: Flex Attachment Steps"
---

Setting up the Thermocycler on your robot includes attaching it to the deck and running a first-time calibration process. The instructions here and on the touchscreen will help you get started. The tools you need are included in the User Kit that came with your Flex.

## Attaching the Thermocycler

<div class="instruction-list" markdown>

1. Use a 2.5 mm hex screwdriver to remove the A1 expansion slot plate and the A1 and B1 deck slot plates.

2. Using both hands, lift the module carefully and insert it into its caddy. Make sure the module's exhaust port faces the exhaust duct on the caddy.

3. Use a 2.5 mm hex screwdriver to turn the anchor screws clockwise to tighten the anchors. The module is secure when it doesn't move while gently pulling on it and rocking it from side to side.

4. Connect the USB cable to the module and route the remaining cable through the cable management bracket.

5. Connect the power connector to the module by pressing it firmly into place. Route the remaining cable through the cable management bracket.

6. Insert the caddy, exhaust duct first, into the open deck slot. Route the USB and power cables through the removable side covers as you lower the caddy into position.

7. Connect the USB cable to a USB port on the Flex.

8. Connect the power cable from the module to the external power supply unit. Manually tighten the locking ring to secure it to the power supply.

9. Connect the power supply to a wall outlet and turn on the power supply. If you see a white light on the Thermocycler, it is powered on. 

10. Press the illuminated button on the Thermocycler to open the lid.

11. Remove and discard the shipping insert after opening the module's lid. The insert consists of a pad attached to a PCR plate.

When successfully connected, the module appears in the Pipettes and Modules section on your robot's device detail page in the Opentrons App.

Next, you'll calibrate the module.

## Calibrating the Thermocycler

You need to calibrate the Thermocycler after attaching it for the first time. To calibrate the Thermocycler, turn on the power supply. This starts the calibration workflow process on the touchscreen. Instructions on the touchscreen will take you through a guided workflow process, which is also outlined below.

    The gantry and pipette move during calibration. Keep your hands clear of the working area before tapping an action button on the touchscreen.

1. Tap **Start setup** on the touchscreen. The robot checks the module's firmware and updates it automatically, if required.

2. Attach the module's calibration adapter and tap **Confirm placement**.

3. Attach the calibration probe to the indicated pipette.

4. Tap **Begin calibration**.

5. After the calibration process is complete, remove the calibration block from the module and remove the calibration probe from the pipette.

6. Click **Exit**.

Your module is now calibrated. You will not have to recalibrate the same module if you remove and reattach it to the same Flex.
