# UV Specifications

The HEPA/UV Module holds two compact fluorescent UV bulbs. When on, the bulbs emit UV-C at the 254 nm wavelength. At this wavelength, UV-C disinfects by killing or damaging the genetic material found in various microorganisms. After a 15-minute exposure cycle, the ultraviolet light produced is sufficient to achieve log-4 (99.99%) inactivation of commonly targeted microorganisms within the enclosure.

## Safety features

The HEPA/UV Module produces high-intensity ultraviolet light (UV-C). The Flex and the HEPA/UV Module come with features that protect you from UV-C exposure and prevent it from operating in an unsafe manner.

| Safety feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Panels | The robot’s polycarbonate door and side panels block UV-spectrum light to below a level which represents an exposure risk. Never operate the UV lights with the robot’s door or side panels removed. |
| Door switch | Flex uses a mechanical switch to tell if the front door is open or closed. The UV lights only work when the front door is closed. Opening the door deactivates/disables the UV lights. This safety interlock works even when Flex is turned off. |
| Attachment sensor | The Flex and HEPA/UV Module each have a built-in sensor to detect if the module is attached properly. The sensors deactivate/disable the UV lights if the module is not mounted on the robot, removed while in operation, or misaligned. |

!!! warning
    - Direct exposure to UV-C light can damage your eyes and exposed skin. Always take care to protect your eyes and skin from exposure while the UV lights are on.
    - Properly attach a fixture or deck plate cover in every deck slot before turning the UV lights on. Never operate the UV lights with empty deck cutouts.
