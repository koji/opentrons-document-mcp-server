!!! warning

    - *Do not* disassemble the HEPA/UV Module and attempt to clean its internal electronic components.

| Solution | Description |
|---|---|
| Alcohol | Includes ethyl/ethanol, isopropyl, and methanol. Dilute to 70% for cleaning. Do not use 100% alcohol. |

## Cleaning the HEPA/UV Module

Be sure to turn the power off before cleaning the module. You can clean the exposed surfaces of the module while it’s installed on the Flex. However, for better access, you may want to:

- Disconnect the AUX and power cables before you begin.
- Remove the HEPA/UV Module from the Flex.

Once you’ve prepared the module for cleaning:

1. Dampen a soft, clean cloth or paper towel with a cleaning solution.
2. Gently wipe off the surface of the module.
3. Use a cloth dampened with distilled water as a rinse wipedown.
4. Let the module air dry.

## Broken bulb cleanup

The fluorescent UV bulbs used by the HEPA/UV Module contain small amounts of mercury. Intact bulbs do not present a health hazard, but a broken bulb can release mercury vapor. If a bulb breaks, follow your institution’s protocols for cleaning broken compact fluorescent bulbs.
