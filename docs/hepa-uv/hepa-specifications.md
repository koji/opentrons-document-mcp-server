# HEPA Specifications

The Flex HEPA/UV Module uses a two-stage filtration system to purify air pulled into the enclosure. This system includes a reusable pre-filter and a disposable H14 HEPA main filter. The pre-filter traps large particles while the HEPA filter captures up to 99.99% of airborne particulate matter at ≥ 0.3 microns (μm). Vertical air flow from the HEPA filter creates a positive-pressure environment within the enclosure. This air boundary helps protect samples inside the Flex from external contamination. The air cleaning system of the Flex HEPA/UV Module meets ISO-5 clean bench standards.
