# Maintenance

Aside from replacing the UV bulbs and filters, users should not attempt to service or repair the HEPA/UV Module themselves. If you have concerns about the moduleâ€™s performance or require maintenance, please [contact Opentrons Support](mailto:support@opentrons.com).

## Bulb replacement

The UV bulbs are user-replaceable items. To purchase a new bulb, [contact Opentrons Support](mailto:support@opentrons.com).

## Filter maintenance

You can clean and reuse the pre-filter but not the HEPA filter. Always replace your dirty HEPA filter with a fresh filter. To purchase a new set of filters, [contact Opentrons Support](mailto:support@opentrons.com).
